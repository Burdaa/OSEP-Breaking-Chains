# OSEP-Breaking-Chains

## Journey

At the time of writing this I am about halfway through the PEN-300 course. Although I say this about every offsec course I take, this course has been very motivational. Granted I've taken longer on the course materials than I wanted to, this is mostly because I tend to beyond what is expected from an exercise or extra mile because I like to tinker. It helps in the long run, but hurts the lab timer, oh well. 

## Code Snippets

As I progress through the course, I am suiting up some code snippets that I will share here. The intent here is to give you a taste of some of the techniques you'll get exposed to with the hopes of motivating you to join your peers by enrolling in the course.
