# OSEP-Breaking-Chains

## Journey

At the time of writing this I am about halfway through the PEN-300 course. Although I say this about every offsec course I take, this course has been very motivational. Granted I've taken longer on the course materials than I wanted to, this is mostly because I tend to beyond what is expected from an exercise or extra mile because I like to tinker. It helps in the long run, but hurts the lab timer, oh well.
